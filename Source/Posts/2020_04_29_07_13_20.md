It has been a long time since I posted on this blog, too long if you ask me. So time to change that.
I changed my posting method, again. Oh well. My current setup is the following:

* editor: VS Code
* static site generator: PHP and wget, glued together with a short CMD script
* upload tool: rclone
* file hosting: Backblaze B2
* CDN: BunnyCDN
* recieving webmentions: [webmention.io](https://webmention.io)

Is this a superb setup? Possibly not. Does it work? I hope so ;)
