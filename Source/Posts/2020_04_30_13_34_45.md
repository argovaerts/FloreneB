Another day, another post for the challenge. Today I want to share two IFTTT snippets I made to run this blog.
<i>Disclaimer: completely untested, this is the test ;)</i>

The first is to send webmentions: <a href="https://www.webmention.app/docs#using-ifttt-to-trigger-checks">RSS + Web Request</a>

A similar approach is used for the second snippet. Here I combine the <a href="https://granary.io/url?input=html&output=atom&url=https://q4.re">same RSS feed</a> with the Twitter integration to post to my Twitter account.

As I have a stream styled blog, all in one single page, I don't know if these work. Especially the first one is tricky. So here we go: <a href="https://q4.re/#2020_04_29_07_13_20">a previous post</a>

In a follow up post I will let you know if everything works.

Just a small extra: 
<blockquote cite="https://qfp.quaker.org.uk/passage/20-04/">
    <p>When work does not turn out as was expected or intended, do not let it depress you. If you are working from a right motive, and doing your best under the guidance of a loving Father in heaven, your work cannot be and is not failureâ€¦ Remember that the Lord never lays work upon His people that He does not give them strength or ability to perform, and if it please Him in the working out of His great purposes that life shall be sacrificed or cut short in the midst of the work, be assured that the work will not permanently suffer from such a cause.</p>
